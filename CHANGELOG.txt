# Changelog
### Release v0.7.0, Codename "Cobalt".

Okay, before I tell you all about the new features and bug fixes, I'd like to thank
everybody that is actively using Macchina, and especially our contributors.

I'm very grateful that people find Macchina as interesting as I do. Our codebase has grown from a small,
glued-together set of instructions, to two independent packages, providing users and developers
the opportunity to inspect the code and actually enjoy doing so :)

**Let's take a look at the new changes:**
- ASCII art now adapts to how many readouts are displayed, as suggested by @Ramiferous.
- Updated Linux big ASCII art variant.
- The title of "Emoji" theme, now named "Boron", can now be changed, and its separator has been modified too.
- Removed jemallocator from the dependency list, this is due to build errors primarily with libc,  
we started using this a while back, because its performance improvements were promising,  
but I have just come to the conclusion that the headaches it causes aren't worth it for the most part.
- A "Beryllium" theme has appeared!
- Themes now print their own name in the box title.
- Benchmarking with hyperfine has finally been fixed.
- Update Linux and NetBSD benchmarks.
- libmacchina: Optimizations for Linux, Android and OpenWrt by implementing an interface for `sysinfo`  
struct and using that when possible.
- libmacchina (Linux): Optimize terminal fetching by utilizing a custom implementation instead of calling `ps`.
- libmacchina (Linux): Distribution should now return NAME and VERSION whenever possible,  
previously it was NAME and VERSION_ID.

@123marvin123:
- Fixed an issue where the palette doesn't respect the user-provided padding value.

@uttarayan21:
- Added command autocompletion for bash and fish.
- libmacchina: Refactored many functions, fixing a lot of clippy's warnings.
- libmacchina: Added Android support.

Changes unrelated to the release:
- `macchina` AUR package no longer pulls from main but downloads the most recent release.
- A new AUR package, `macchina-git`, has been created and is being maintained by @uttarayan21.
