### New features
Macchina's custom ASCII art implementation is now much smarter than before,
thanks to the amazing work of @uttarayan21, and his brilliant parser
[ansi-to-tui](https://github.com/uttarayan21/ansi-to-tui), go on, give it a star!

How smart is it? Well, it can now parse ANSI characters to determine how to color
the specified ascii. Want to give it a go? You'll find a directory named "ascii" 
in the source code, that contains some ascii files generated by `jp2a` which you 
can show alongside your beautiful system information. You can use your own too, of course!

You'll also notice there's a new "contrib" directory too, which has a neat bash script 
that can download a video from any site that is supported by youtube-dl, and display it
alongside your machine information, this is another one of @uttarayan21's contributions :)

### Bug fixes
